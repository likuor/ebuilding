## Getting Started

I'll send you my environmental variables for mongoDB and Strapi through email in case if you don't have them due to considering the security.

### Frontend setup
At the root front directory, please add the environmental variable of MongoDB at it.

* npm
  ```sh
  cd front
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
